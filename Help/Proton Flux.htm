<h1>Proton Flux</h1>

High energy protons emitted by the Sun reach the Earth and,
moving along the magnetic field lines to the polar regions, 
hit the polar cap areas.
Polar cap absorption (PCA) events result from the ionisation of the D-layer 
of the polar ionosphere by high energy protons. PCA events cause 
HF radio blackouts for trans-polar circuits and can last for 
several days.


<p>
<span class=BluB>Proton Flux</span>:
<i>
The proton flux at energies greater than 10 MeV
expressed in particles per cm<sup>2</sup> per steradian per second.
</i>

<p>
Use the Proton Flux value as an indicator of the PCA events.
