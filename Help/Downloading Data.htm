<h1>Downloading Data</h1>
<br>
<h2>Download Engine</h2>
Ionoprobe uses Microsoft Internet Explorer as a download
engine. It does not open the browser window,
but it loads some IE modules in the background.
Because of this, you do not have to tell Ionoprobe your
proxy address, dial-up settings, authentication 
passwords, etc. Just make sure that you have the latest
Internet Explorer and that it is properly configured.
If you can browse the Internet with IE, you can
download data with IonoProbe.



<br><br><br><br>
<h2>Download Modes</h2>

Iono probe can work in either the 
<span class=BluB>Auto-Download</span> or 
<span class=BluB>Manual Download</span>
 mode. If you have a permanent connection to the Internet or
an unlimited dial-up connection, use Auto-Download at all times, 
this will ensure that you always have the latest space weather 
indices and a continuous set of historical data. 
<p>
When 
Auto-Download is enabled, IonoProbe downloads data according to a 
carefully designed schedule that takes into account the update time
and frequency of the files on the Web, and the amount of data in the 
files. The schedule itself is updated at regular intervals 
from the Ionoprobe Web site.
<p>
If Auto-Download is disabled, you still can initiate downloads
manually using the commands described in the next section.
<p>
You can enable or disable the Auto-Download mode:

<ul>
<li> by ticking the
<span class=Blu>Auto-Download Data</span> checkbox in the
<a href="Settings Dialog.htm">Settings Dialog</a>;
<br><br>


<li>by clicking on the 
<span class=Blu>Download -> Auto-Download</span>
command in the 
<a href="Menu.htm">Main Menu</a>;
<br><br>

<li>by clicking on 
<span class=Blu>Auto-Download</span> 
in the System Tray icon's
<a href="Popup Menu.htm">Popup Menu</a>;
<br><br>


<li>by double-clicking on the
<span class=Blu>Download Status</span>
 icon (see below).
</ul>

<p>
When <span class=Blu>Auto-Download Data</span> is enabled,
you can specify if text reports will be included 
in the downloads or not, by ticking the
<span class=BluB>Including reports</span> checkbox
in the 
<a href="Settings Dialog.htm">Settings Dialog</a>.

<br><br><br><br>
<h2>Download Commands</h2>

<span class=BluB>Download Latest Data</span><br>
Download the current values of all parameters.


<p>
<span class=BluB>Download Recent Data</span><br>
Since some files include data for a calendar day, downloading
<span class=Blu>Latest Data</span>
shortly after 00:00 UTC will give you only a few values.
Use the Download Recent Data command to retrieve data for the 
previous day. This command is executed automatically on program
start if 
<span class=Blu>Auto-Download Data</span>
is enabled.

<p>
<span class=BluB>Download Old Data</span><br>
IonoProbe keeps the data downloaded in the previous sessions
so that you have a historical view of the parameters. 
However, if you 
are running the program for the first time or after a long break,
then no historical data are available. In such cases the 
Download Old Data command comes handy.

<p>
<span class=BluB>Download Reports</span><br>
If you disabled automatic downlaods of 
<a href="Reports Panel.htm">NOAA reports</a>,
you can use this menu command to download the latest reports
manually.

<p>
<span class=BluB>Abort Download</span><br>
Immediately stop all running downloads.

<p>
All commands listed above work in both download modes.
E.g., you can issue the 
<span class=Blu>Download Recent Data</span> command
when you are in the Auto-download mode if you think that
some recent data are missing.



<br><br><br><br>
<h2>Download Status</h2>
A small icon in the bottom-right 
corner of the window indicates the status of the 
download engine:
<br><br><center>
<img src="Status.gif" width="53" height="43" alt="" border="0">
</center>

<p>
The following images are displayed:


<br><br><br>
<img src="StopDL.gif" width="13" height="16" alt="" border="0">
- Auto-Download disabled;

<p>
<img src="WaitDL.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="" border="0">
- waiting for the next download cycle;

<p>
<img src="InProgressDL.gif" width="13" height="14" alt="" border="0">

<p>
<img src="OkDL.gif" width="13" height="12" alt="" border="0">

<p>
<img src="ErrDL.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" border="0">
- some downloads failed;

<p>
<img src="AllFailedDL.gif" width="13" height="15" alt="" border="0">
- all downloads failed. Double-check your IE configuration.


<br><br><br>
The icon has a mouse-over hint that displays
additional status information, including the number
of downloaded files, the error count,
and the time left to the next download.
