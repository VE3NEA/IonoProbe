<h1>SSN and SFI</h1>

Long distance HF propagation is possible due to the ionosphere, 
a set of conductive layers in the upper atmosphere 
that refract radio waves 
back to the Earth (and also absorb them).
To estimate the level of refraction and absorption,
it is important to know the degree of ionization in the ionosphere
(the number of electrons per cubic meter).
Strong ionization results in the refraction of higher frequencies
but also increases the signal absorption.

<p>
The main source of electrons in the ionosphere is the
ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Unfortunately, real time 
UV flux data are not available on the Web. Two surrogate parameters 
are used to estimate the level of ionization,
<span class=Blu>Sunspot Number</span> (SSN) and
<span class=Blu>Solar Flux Index</span> (SFI).
<br><br><br>


<span class=BluB>Sunspot Number</span>:
<i>
the daily number of sunspots and sunspot groups 
obtained from the optical observations.
</i>



<br><br><br>
<span class=BluB>Solar Flux Index</span>:
<i>
the intensity of solar radio emission 
with a wavelength of 10.7 cm (about 2800 MHz).
</i>



<br><br><br>
Both parameters are statistically correlated with
the level of atmospheric ionization,

but there is no direct relationship:
daily variations of SSN or SFI are not always associated with changes in the 
 ionosphere. These parameters are useful as trend indicators: 
if SSN and SFI have been high for a number of days, 
you can expect higher values of MUF and stronger absoprtion.
