.topic 1
Kp index:


A 3-hourly planetary index of geomagnetic activity



Impact on HF propagarion:


A disturbance in the geomagnetic field can often 

cause a disturbance in the F region of the 

ionosphere, resulting in an ionospheric storm. 

Higher frequencies are most affected by such

storms. Ionospheric storms may last for a number 

of days

.topic 2
Auroral activity index:


An estimation of the total power input by auroral 

particles to the polar regions on the scale 

of 1 to 10



Impact on HF propagarion:


Auroral Absorption events (AA) on HF 

Auroral propagation on VHF

.topic 3
Proton flux:


The energetic (> 10 MeV) proton flux, 15 minute 

average



Impact on HF propagarion:


Polar Cap Absorption (PCA) events. Degrade signals 

passing through the polar D region, last for 

up to 10 days

.topic 4
X-ray flux:


The 1 - 8 A solar x-ray flux, 15 minute average



Impact on HF propagarion:


Short wave fadeouts (SWF) in the daylit part of the 

ionosphere. Affect lower frequencies most, last from

tens of minutes to hours

.topic 5
Sunspot number:


The observed daily number of sunspots and sunspot groups

.topic 6
Solar flux index:


Solar radio noise flux at a wavelength of 10.7 cm



Impact on HF propagarion:


Radiation of this wavelength does not affect 

the ionosphere. However, SFI is correlated 

with the solar UV flux responsible for

the ionization in the upper layers of atmosphere. 

The higher the SFI, the higher MUF can be expected.

.topic 7
Ap index:


Daily global index of geomagnetic activity derived 

from the 8  3-hourly values of Kp



Impact on HF propagarion:


See Kp

.topic 8
Proton background flux:


A daily average background proton flux

at energies greater than 10 MeV

.topic 9
X-ray background flux:


A daily average background X-ray flux 

in the 1 to 8 Angstrom range

.topic 10
Effective Sunspot Number:


The value of the sunspot number 

that provides the best match between 

the mathematical model of the ionosphere 

and the observed critical frequencies 

of the F-layer.


Can be used as an input into the

propagation prediction programs for

real-time propagation forecasts.

Geomagnetic storm



Impact on HF propagarion:


G2  -  HF radio propagation can fade at higher 

  latitudes


G3  -  HF radio may be intermittent


G4  -  HF radio propagation sporadic


G5  -  HF radio propagation may be impossible 

  in many areas for one to two days

Impact on HF propagarion:


S1  -  minor impacts on HF radio in the polar 

  regions


S2  -  small effects on HF propagation through 

  the polar regions


S3  -  degraded HF radio propagation through the 

  polar regions


S4  -  blackout of HF radio communications 

  through the polar regions


S5  -  complete blackout of HF communications 

  possible through the polar regions

.topic 103
Radio blackout



Impact on HF propagarion:


R1  -  weak or minor degradation of HF radio 

  communication on sunlit side, occasional loss 

  of radio contact


R2  -  limited blackout of HF radio communication

  on sunlit side, loss of radio contact for tens of minutes


R3  -  wide area blackout of HF radio communication,

  loss of radio contact for about an hour on sunlit 

  side of Earth


R4  -  HF radio communication blackout on most of 

  the sunlit side of Earth for one to two hours. 

  HF radio contact lost during this time


R5  -  HF radio blackout on the entire sunlit side 

  of the Earth lasting for a number of hours
