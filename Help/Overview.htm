Space weather is of great importance to Amateur Radio 
as it controls the HF propagation. Current solar and
geomagnetic activity indices are published
on hundreds of Web sites, and serious DX'ers check 
these indices regularly and even keep notes of the 
past values for analysis.
<p>
IonoProbe automates this time-consuming work.
It is a small 32 bit Windows application that lives 
in the System Tray and monitors the space weather parameters 
essential for HF radio. IonoProbe 
downloads near-real time satellite and ground station data 
as well as indices derived from these data, stores information 
for future use and displays it in a user-friendly manner. 
The main source of data is the 
<a href="http://www.sel.noaa.gov" target ="_blank">NOAA Web site</a>.
<p>
Time-critical parameters, such as 
<a href="X-ray Flux.htm">X-ray Flux</a>, 
<a href="Proton Flux.htm">Proton Flux</a> and 
<a href="Auroral activity.htm">Auroral activity index</a>, are updated every 15 minutes, and 
<a href="Using Alerts.htm">Alerts</a> can be
set up to notify you of a storm within a few minutes after its start.
