<h1>X-Ray Flux</h1>

A burst of X-ray radiation from the Sun covers all sunlit area of the Earth
and causes extra ionization of the D-layer which results in 
higher absorption of HF radio waves. This is called a Short-Wave 
Fadeout (SWF) or a Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance (SID).

<p>
<span class=BluB>X-Ray Flux</span>:
<i>
X-ray flux in the 1 to 8 Angstrom range expressed in 
Watts/m<sup>2</sup>.
</i>

<p>
The X-ray Flux parameter displayed in IonoProbe can be used
as an indicator of the SWF events.
