<h1>Using Alerts</h1>

Two types of storm alerts are available in IonoProbe,
<span class=Blu>WWV Alerts</span> and
<span class=Blu>Real-Time Alerts</span>.

<br><br><br>
<h2>WWV Alerts</h2>

IonoProbe downloads the WWV Geophysical Alerts and displays them
in an easy to understand way.
These alerts are updated every 3 hours and cover the last
24-hour period as well as provide information about the storms
expected in the next 24 hours.

<p>
Three types of storms are reported by WWV:


<p>
<b>G0</b> - <b>G5</b>: geomagnetic storms;<br>
<b>S0</b> - <b>S5</b>: solar radiation storms;<br>
<b>R0</b> - <b>R5</b>: radio blackouts.<br>

<p>
Storm levels are displayed with six 'lamps'. 
The colors of lamps change from green through yellow to red
to reflect the storm level; past values are dimmed.
Mouse-over hints provide text representation of the conditions.

<p>
Click on the lamps for a description of storm types
and storm level codes.


<br><br><br><br>
<h2>Real-Time Alerts</h2>

Some space weather events, such as X-Ray bursts 
that cause radio blackouts, last from tens of minutes to 
a few hours. WWV alerts are not frequent enough to report 
such events in real time. 
<br><br>
IonoProbe has its own system of alerts based on 
the real-time data. It monitors the 
<a href="X-ray Flux.htm">X-ray Flux</a>, 
<a href="Proton Flux.htm">Proton Flux</a> and 
<a href="Kp and Ap.htm">Kp Index</a>
and fires an alarm when the value crosses the red line.
You can enable or disable the audio alarm in the
<a href="Settings Dialog.htm">Settings Dialog</a>.

<p>

When a storm is in progress, the 
<a href="Systray Icon.htm">Systray Icon</a>
turns from blue 
<img src="BlueIcon.gif" width="16" height="14" alt="" border="0">
to red
<img src="RedIcon.gif" width="16" height="14" alt="" border="0">,
and its mouse-over hint displays the storm message.
