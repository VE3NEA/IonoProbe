<h1>Kp and Ap</h1>

While the UV radiation creates free electrons in the ionosphere,
the magnetic field of the Earth keeps those electrons in place. 
Being charged particles, electrons spiral around the
magnetic field lines and stay in the layer where they were created,
instead of flying away. The geofield serves as a <i>vessel</i>
for the electrons,
allowing the electron density in the F layer reach the levels sufficient 
for ionospheric HF propagation.

<p>
This mechanism works fine only when the geomagnetic field is quiet.
During the geostorms <i>the vessel cracks</i>, and electrons leak
from the F layer. The MUF drops considerably, and the upper bands close.
Geomagnetic storms last from several hours to a few days, 
then it may take solar UV a few more days to restore the original
electron density in the F layer.


<p>
Two space weather parameters indicate the state of the geomagnetic
field, the <span class=Blu>Kp index</span> and the
<span class=Blu>Ap index</span>.


<br><br><br>
<span class=BluB>Kp index</span>:
<i>
a 3-hourly planetary index of geomagnetic activity expressed in the
logarithmic units on a scale from 0 to 9.
</i>


<br><br><br>
<span class=BluB>Ap index</span>:
<i>
a daily planetary index of geomagnetic activity derived 

from the 8 &nbsp;&nbsp; 3-hourly values of Kp. 
Unlike Kp, Ap is expressed in linear units on a scale
from 0 to about 400.
</i>

<p>
Both indices are equally important:
<span class=Blu>Kp</span>
tells you if a geostorm is in progress, and
<span class=Blu>Ap</span> indicates
whether the storm has just started
or it has been developing for a while.

<p>
With IonoProbe, you are not limited to the current values
of the indices. The history of
<span class=Blu>Kp</span>
for the last few days provides detailed information about
the development of the storm
and allows you to estimate its consequencies more accurately.
