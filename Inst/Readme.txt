IonoProbe is a 32 bit Windows application that lives
in the System Tray and monitors the space weather parameters
essential for HF radio. The list of parameters includes SSN/SFI,
Ap/Kp, X-ray/Proton flux, and Auroral activity. IonoProbe
downloads near-real time satellite and ground station data,
stores information for future reference and displays it
in a user-friendly way.

Time-critical parameters, such as X-ray and proton flux and
auroral index, are updated every 15 minutes, and an alarm can be
set up to notify you of a storm within a few minutes after its start.
