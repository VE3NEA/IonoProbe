IMPORTANT:

IonoProbe requires Internet Explorer 5 or higher properly installed and configured to access the Internet. If you do not have the latest IE on your system, please install it prior to running IonoProbe. 

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE IE5 AS YOUR DEFAULT BROWSER, it just has to be present on your system.
