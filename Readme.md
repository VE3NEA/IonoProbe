# IonoProbe

IonoProbe used to be a [shareware product](http://www.dxatlas.com/ionoprobe), but after NOAA stopped providing the real-time ionosonde data required for this software to work, the product was discontinued. Its source code is provided here for educational purposes. Delphi 5 Pro is required to build the project.
